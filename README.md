# Mini Radar Simulation System

This project simulates a basic radar system that emits pulses, receives echoes from simulated targets, and processes the signal to detect object distances. The simulation includes noise modeling and visual output.

## Features
- Pulse generation
- Target reflection modeling
- Additive noise
- Signal processing (FFT)
- Visualization of detections
