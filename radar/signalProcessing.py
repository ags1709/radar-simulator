    Apply matched filtering to detect echoes in the received signal.
    
    The matched filter is the optimal linear filter for maximizing the 
    signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of additive white noise.
    It correlates the received signal with a time-reversed, conjugated 
    copy of the transmitted pulse.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    received_signal : np.ndarray
        The received radar signal containing echoes and noise.
    pulse : np.ndarray
        The transmitted radar pulse (reference signal).
    normalize : bool, optional
        If True, normalize the output by the pulse energy. Default is True.
    
    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Matched filter output with same length as received_signal.

    Cell-Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate (CA-CFAR) detector.
    
    CA-CFAR maintains a constant probability of false alarm by adaptively
    setting the detection threshold based on the local noise estimate from
    surrounding cells.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : np.ndarray
        Input signal (typically matched filter output magnitude).
    num_train : int
        Number of training cells on each side for noise estimation.
    num_guard : int
        Number of guard cells on each side to exclude target energy.
    pfa : float
        Desired probability of false alarm.
    peak_guard : int
        Window size for local maximum detection (suppresses sidelobes).
